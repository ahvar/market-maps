# Market Maps
The market map is a versatile, exploratory tool used to analyze and present data on a specific product, industry, or service. It is accessible to the public for general education purposes while providing enough detail and sophistication for use in professional applications. A business analyst may use it to present new market opportunities or potentially disruptive technologies. Journalists could use the maps to report on current socioeconomic issues, changing demographics, or cultural histories.
